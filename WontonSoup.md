# Wonton Soup
This quick and easy wonton soup is super simple, loaded with veggies and takes under 15 minutes to make.
This makes a great lunch, or if you want to make it a larger multi-course meal add Cauliflower Fried Rice or Spicy Shrimp Brown Fried Rice, Chicken and Broccoli Stir Fry or Pepper Steak.

## Ingredients
 - 6 cups chicken broth low sodium
 - 1- inch piece fresh ginger, sliced thin
 - 1 clove minced garlic
 - 20 mini frozen wontons (I love the Chicken Cilantro one’s from Trader Joe’s)
 - 1 1/2 cups sliced shiitake mushrooms
 - 4 baby bok choy, halved lengthwise and halved
 - 1 tablespoon soy sauce
 - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
 - scallions, sliced green parts only for garnish

## Instructions

1. Bring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot.
2. Smash the sliced ginger with the side of a knife to bring out the flavor and add to the pot with the garlic, cover and cook 5 minutes.
3. Add the bok choy and partially cook 5 minutes, then add the frozen wontons and mushroom, simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until the wontons are heated through and bok choy is tender and wilted.
4. Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil.
5. Divide soup in four bowls. Garnish with fresh scallions.
